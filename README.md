<p align="center">
  <b>IoT enthusiast, perfectionist and a little bit crazy</b>
</p>

First and foremost, I spend most of my development time on [Z-Wave JS](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js), a Z-Wave driver written entirely in TypeScript. Started in 2018, Z-Wave JS has breathed new life into the Z-Wave ecosystem and now powers thousands of smart homes and some of the largest home automation systems all over the world.

Speaking of smart home, I'm a contributor to [ioBroker](https://www.iobroker.net/), where I maintain adapters for [Trådfri](https://github.com/AlCalzone/ioBroker.tradfri), [BLE](https://github.com/AlCalzone/ioBroker.ble) and [Z-Wave](https://github.com/AlCalzone/ioBroker.zwave2/) and where I'm striving to make the developer experience better for everyone.

Besides that, I'm developing and maintaining several libraries to bring low-level IoT protocols into the Node.js world: [DTLS](https://github.com/AlCalzone/node-dtls-client), [CoAP(s)](https://github.com/AlCalzone/node-coap-client), and [`node-tradfri-client`](https://github.com/AlCalzone/node-tradfri-client). If you are interfacing a Trådfri or Philips Hue bridge, you might be using one of them.
